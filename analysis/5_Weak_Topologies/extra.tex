\section{Prove that the given set of functions converges weakly but not strongly}

Consider $\mathscr{X} = C[0,1]$, the Banach Space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm.

Consider sequence of functions $(f_n)_{n \ge 2}$, where

$$
f_n(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            xn & \quad 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{n} \\
            2 - nx & \quad \frac{1}{n} < x \leq \frac{2}{n} \\
            0 & \quad \frac{2}{n} < x \le 1
        \end{array}
    \right.
 $$
 
 $D_n = \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{F}: | \alpha | \le 1 \}$
 
 
 
(Starts at 0, goes up to 1 at 1/n, down to 0 at 2/n, and stays flat from there).

Denote $0 \in \mathscr{X}$ as function $z(x) = 0$ for $0 \le x \le 1$.

Claim is that $f_n \rightharpoonup z$, but that $f_n \not\rightarrow z$.

First, $|| f_n - 0 || = || f_n || = 1$ for all $n$, so $f_n$ does not converge to $0$ (TODO: Prove it doesn't converge at all?)

Suppose $L$ is a continuous linear functional such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} L(f_n) \ne 0$. Therefore there is some subsequence $b_n$ and $\varepsilon$ such that $L(b_n) > \varepsilon$. Choose a further subsequence of $b_n$, called $c_n$ where the $c_n$ have disjoint support

$d_n = \sum_{i=1}^n c_n$
