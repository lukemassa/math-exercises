\section{Show that wk is the smallest topology on $\mathscr{X}$ such that each $x^*$ in $\mathscr{X}^*$}

Must show that an arbitrary open set in wk can be generated by some collection of sets of the form $x^{*-1}(V)$.

Start with an arbitrary open set $U$. Since $X$ with wk is a locally convex set, $\bigcap^n_{i=1}\{x\epsilon \mathscr{X} : p_j( x-x_0) < \varepsilon_j\} \subseteq U$ for some finite list of $\varepsilon$ and $p$, where $p_{x^*}=|\langle x,x^*\rangle|$.

 $\bigcap^n_{i=1}\{x\in \mathscr{X} : p_j( x-x_0) < \varepsilon_j\}$ is open and the intersection of pre-images of open sets from $\mathbb{F}$ (why?).

Since $U$ is generated by the subbase of preimages of the collection of $x^*$ and $U$ is arbitrary, all open sets of wk are generated in this way, thus is the smallest possible topology.

\section{Show that wk* is the smallest topology on $\mathscr{X}^*$ such that for each $x$ in $\mathscr{X}$, $x^* \mapsto \langle x, x^* \rangle$}


This purported topology $\sigma$ is generated by open sets that are preimages of open sets of functions of the form $x^* \mapsto \langle x, x^* \rangle$. By continuity of composition, they are also the preimages of open sets of functions of the form $x^* \mapsto | \langle x, x^* \rangle | $. Open sets of $\mathbb{R}$ are generated by open balls, so the pre-images are generated by sets of the form $| \langle x, x^* \rangle | < \varepsilon $.

A set $U$ of $\mathscr{X}^*$ is weakly open if and only if for every $x^*_0$ in $U$ there is an $\varepsilon$ and there are $x_1, ... x_n$ in $\mathscr{X}$ such that 

$$\bigcap^n_{i=1}\{x^*\in \mathscr{X}^* : |\langle x_k, x^* - x^*_0 \rangle| < \varepsilon_j\} \subseteq U$$

Every such set $U$ can be generated as part of $\sigma$ and therefore is the smallest topology 


\section{If $A\subseteq\mathscr{X}$, show that $A$ is weakly bounded if and only if $A^{\circ}$ is absorbing in $\mathscr{X}^*$}

Assume $A$ is weakly bounded. 

Assume $A^{\circ}$ is absorbing in $\mathscr{X}^*$
