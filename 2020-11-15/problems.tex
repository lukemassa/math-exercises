\section{Show that wk is the smallest topology on $\mathscr{X}$ such that each $x^*$ in $\mathscr{X}^*$}

Must show that an arbitrary open set in wk can be generated by some collection of sets of the form $x^{*-1}(V)$.

Start with an arbitrary open set $U$. Since $X$ with wk is a locally convex set, $\bigcap^n_{i=1}\{x\epsilon \mathscr{X} : p_j( x-x_0) < \varepsilon_j\} \subseteq U$ for some finite list of $\varepsilon$ and $p$, where $p_{x^*}=|<x,x^*>|$. Say it's $x_1^*$, $x_2^*$ ... $x_n^*$.

Since $U$ is generated by the subbase of preimages of the collection of $x^*$ and $U$ is arbitrary, all open sets of wk are generated in this way, thus is the smallest possible topology.
